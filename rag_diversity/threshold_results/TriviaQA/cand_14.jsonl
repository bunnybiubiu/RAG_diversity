["Too many text was provided, not related to Bill Wyman's solo career.", 'The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2004 the chart has been based on the sales of both physical singles and digital downloads, with airplay figures excluded from the official chart. This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 2005, as well as singles which peaked in 2004 and 2006 but were in the top 10 in 2005. The entry date is when the song appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).\nTwo hundred and twenty-eight singles were in the top ten in 2005. Ten singles from 2004 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while "When I\'m Gone" by Eminem was released in 2005 but did not reach its peak until 2006. Fifty-two artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 2005.  Akon, Arctic Monkeys, James Blunt, Rihanna, Kaiser Chiefs and The Pussycat Dolls were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 2005.\nTo mark Elvis Presley\'s 70th birthday, all eighteen of his UK number-one singles were re-released. The first single, "All Shook Up", came with a collectors\' box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the UK top 5. Two of the three re-released singles which topped the chart - "One Night"/"I Got Stung" and "It\'s Now or Never" - were also the first and second singles in chart history to spend their only week in the top 10 at number-one before dropping out.\nThe 2004 Christmas number-one, "Do They Know It\'s Christmas?" by Band Aid 20, remained at number-one for the first week of 2005. The first new number-one single of the year was "Against All Odds" by 2004 X Factor winner Steve Brookstein. Overall, twenty-eight different singles peaked at number-one in 2005, with Elvis Presley (3) having the most singles hit that position.', 'The answer cannot be determined based on the context provided.']
