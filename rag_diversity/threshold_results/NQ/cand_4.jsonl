["Increased temperatures and rainfall variability in Nigeria due to climate change has led to drought, desertification, rising sea levels, erosion, floods, thunderstorms, bush fires, landslides, and land degradation. This has resulted in reduced food and water security, increasing poverty, conflict, displacement, economic instability, and negative health outcomes. Nigeria is vulnerable and not well prepared to deal with these effects. The agricultural sector is particularly at risk. Nigeria has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% on its own and by 47% with international support by 2030, aiming for net zero by 2060. Climate change mitigation and adaptation plans focus on agriculture, food security, forests, biodiversity, water resources, energy, infrastructure, health, human settlement, industry, commerce, transportation, and communication. Capacity building at various levels is needed to engage in climate change responses. The challenges vary across geographical areas due to different precipitation regimes leading to different impacts. Nigeria's greenhouse gas emissions mainly come from oil and gas production, land-use change, forestry, agriculture, and fugitive emissions. The predictable order of changes in communities after a change occurs is: increased vulnerability, reduced resources, increased poverty, conflict, displacement, economic instability, negative health outcomes, and impacts on various sectors.", 'flooding, harm to ecosystems, disruption of agriculture and aquaculture, increased risks to human health', 'Succession.']
